                <p class="bodytext">Hello, I'm Jack! I'm a math enthusiast and tutor who loves to do and teach math!
                    I love to build confidence in others and bring out their potential. 
                    I am extremely passionate about learning; I take every chance to learn new skills.<br>
                    I am currently a senior at Kimball High School where I have a 4.58 10-12 GPA and straight A's across all 6 completed semesters.
                    Additionally, I have scored 5s on the AP Precalculus, AP Calculus AB, and AP Physics 1 tests.
                    I am also an AP Scholar with Distinction and I have scored a 1510 on the SAT, with a math subscore of 750.<br>
                    In addition to math, I also love music and theatre! 
                    I am serving my second year as the Kimball High School Marching Band's Drum Major and I have acted or been in crew for 4 Kimball theater productions. 
                    In my free time I am a jazz bassist and the president and founder of the Kimball High School Music Club!

                <p class="bodytext">I tutor within the Tracy area, primarily in-person as I feel it helps students learn better but with additional online options.
                    My availability varies, so for scheduling it is best to directly contact me. I charge $25 per hour, minimum 1 hour per week.
